    <h1>Welcome to my journey in New York City!</h1>
    <div class="display-box-title">
        I wanted to create this map to display some of the projects I've had the opportunity to
        work on and contribute to during the last two years. I currently work at Public Works Partners
        , a public consulting firm. My time at the firm is coming to an end as graduate nears. To help
        me remember the last two years, I've decided to create a map showing the project's I've worked on!

      Redesigning Penn Station is a project many within the city are currently working on. My part 
      on this project has mostly dealt with developing strategies for the city to better provide 
      resources for the unhoused population. It has been rewarding work!
