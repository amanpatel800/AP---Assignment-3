<h1>Welcome to my journey in New York City!</h1>
<div class="display-box-title">
    I wanted to create this map to display some of the projects I've had the opportunity to
    work on and contribute to during the last two years. I currently work at Public Works Partners
    , a public consulting firm. My time at the firm is coming to an end as graduate nears. To help
    me remember the last two years, I've decided to create a map showing the project's I've worked on!
