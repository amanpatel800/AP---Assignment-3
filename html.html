    <h1>Welcome to my journey in New York City!</h1>
    <div class="display-box-title">
        I wanted to create this map to display some of the projects I've had the opportunity to
        work on and contribute to during the last two years. I currently work at Public Works Partners
        , a public consulting firm. My time at the firm is coming to an end as graduate nears. To help
        me remember the last two years, I've decided to create a map showing the project's I've worked on!

    <div id="popupContentpenn" class="popup-contentpenn">
      Redesigning Penn Station is a project many within the city are currently working on. My firm has
      been tasked with aidding in this effort. Though I can't say much since the project is ongoing,
      it has been truly rewarding work!

    <div id="popupContentfifth" class="popup-contentfifth">
      Fifth Avenue is being redesigned at last! The project, coined Future of Fifth by the city,
      has several different components. I helped my firm conduct a zoning anaylsis and gather 
      and analaze public opinion. This was my first time dealing with zoning laws in the city, 
      and I found it to be really interesting! Gathering public opinion was rewarding, but challenging.
      Trying to ask New Yorkers to take a survey during their lunch hour is not a simple task.

<!-- Queens Popup container -->
<div id="popupContainerqueens" class="popup-containerqueens">
    <div id="popupContentqueens" class="popup-contentqueens">
My work in queens has foucsed on helping the NYCEDC redevelop a station. I cannot provide too many
details due to the ongoing status of the project; however, what I can say is that this project 
has served as a very important learning opportunity.

<!-- bqe Popup container -->
<div id="popupContainerbqe" class="popup-containerbqe">
    <div id="popupContentbqe" class="popup-contentbqe">
One of my first tasks at my firm was to help develop public materials for the MTA. The one I found 
most interesting were to segments on the IBX (Interbourgh Expressway) that was recently annouced. This project helped inspire my career 
in public transit!

<!-- capstone Popup container -->
<div id="popupContainercap" class="popup-containercap">
    <div id="popupContentcap" class="popup-contentcap">
For my capstone project, I have been tasked with helping NYC311 develop a 10 year roadmap. Though
this project is almost done, I can say it has been one of the most fun projects I have worked on.
I have learned so much about the city through this project, and have a new apperciate for the 
city government and its efforts.
