    <h1>Welcome to my journey in New York City!</h1>
    <div class="display-box-title">
        I wanted to create this map to display some of the projects I've had the opportunity to
        work on and contribute to during the last two years. I currently work at Public Works
        Partners, a public consulting firm. My time at the firm is coming to an end as graduation
        nears. To help me remember the last two years, I've decided to create a map showing the
        projects I've worked on! Click on the buttons on the left side to see my journey.

        <div id="popupContentpenn" class="popup-content">
            Redesigning Penn Station is a project on which many within the city are currently working.
            My firm has been tasked with aiding in this effort. Though I can't say much since the project
            is ongoing, it has been truly rewarding work!

    <!-- fifth Popup container -->
    <div id="popupContainerfifth" class="popup-container">
        <div id="popupContentfifth" class="popup-content">
            Fifth Avenue is finally being redesigned! The project, known as the Future of Fifth by the
            city, consists of several different components. I assisted my firm in conducting a zoning
            analysis and gathering and analyzing public opinion. This was my first time dealing with
            zoning laws in the city, and I found it to be truly interesting! Gathering public opinion
            was rewarding but challenging. Asking New Yorkers to take a survey during their lunch hour
            is no simple task.

    <!-- Queens Popup container -->
    <div id="popupContainerqueens" class="popup-container">
        <div id="popupContentqueens" class="popup-content">
            My work in Queens has focused on assisting the NYCEDC in redeveloping an important
            trasit hub. I cannot provide too many details due to the ongoing status of the project; however,
            what I can say is that this project has served as a very important learning opportunity.

    <div id="popupContaineribx" class="popup-container">
        <div id="popupContentibx" class="popup-content">
            One of my first tasks at my firm was to assist in developing public materials for the MTA.
            The ones I found most interesting were the segments on the IBX (Interborough Expressway)
            that were recently announced. This project helped inspire my career in public transit!

        <div id="popupContentcap" class="popup-content">
            For my capstone project, I have been tasked with helping NYC311 develop a 10-year roadmap.
            Though this project is almost done, I can say it has been one of the most enjoyable projects
            I have worked on. I have learned so much about the city through this project and have gained
            a new appreciation for the city government and its efforts.
